        -> Vector{Vector{NTuple{2,Float64}}}

Compute column-strip polygons in absolute (x, y) coordinates for a cell.

Uses the skeleton-derived tributary polygons and ACI half-depth rule:
- `get_tributary_polygons_isotropic(verts)` → straight-skeleton tributaries
- `compute_panel_strips(tribs)` → column / middle strip split at d_max/2

When `rebar_axis` is provided, the tributary partitioning is **directed**
along the rebar axis using `get_tributary_polygons(verts; axis=rebar_axis)`.
This ensures the CS/MS classification is aligned with the reinforcement
direction, which is essential for consistent moment projection when
`rebar_direction` is set.

When `span_axis` (or `rebar_axis`) is provided, only CS polygons whose edge
is approximately **perpendicular** to that axis are returned.  This matches
the ACI definition: for a given direction, the column strip is the band
centered on the column line (which runs transverse to that direction).

## Drop Panel Widening (Pacoste §4.2.1, Fig 4.4)

When `drop_panel_half_widths` is provided as `(w_span, w_perp)` in meters,
the column strip polygon is widened so its transverse extent is at least
the drop panel half-extent in the perpendicular direction.  This ensures
the distribution width covers the stiffened drop panel zone.

The minimum CS half-width becomes `max(d_max/2, drop_panel_half_width)`,
where `d_max/2` is the standard ACI rule and `drop_panel_half_width` is
the drop panel half-extent perpendicular to the span.

Returns a vector of absolute-coordinate polygons.

    _widen_tributaries_for_drop(tribs, drop_half_widths, span_axis) -> Vector{TributaryPolygon}

Widen tributary polygons so that `d_max/2` (the column strip half-width) is
at least the drop panel half-extent in the perpendicular direction.

For each tributary whose beam edge is approximately perpendicular to the span
axis (i.e., a column-line edge), the relevant drop panel half-width is the
perpendicular-to-span dimension (`drop_half_widths[2]`).  For edges parallel
to the span axis, it's `drop_half_widths[1]`.

The widening is achieved by scaling the `d` values so that `d_max/2 ≥ w_drop`.
This means `d_max ≥ 2 * w_drop`, so we scale: `d_new = d * max(1, 2*w_drop/d_max)`.
