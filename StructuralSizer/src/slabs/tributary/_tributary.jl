"""
    get_tributary_polygons(vertices; weights=nothing, axis=nothing, buffers=nothing)

Compute tributary polygons for each edge of the polygon.

## Arguments
- `vertices::Vector{<:Point}`: Polygon vertices as Meshes.Point objects
- `weights::Union{Nothing, AbstractVector{<:Real}}`: Optional edge weights (one per edge)
- `axis::Union{Nothing, AbstractVector{<:Real}}`: Optional direction vector [vx, vy].
  If `nothing`, uses isotropic straight skeleton. If provided, partitions along that direction.
- `buffers::Union{Nothing, TributaryBuffers}`: Optional pre-allocated buffers to reduce GC.
  Only used for one-way (directed) computation; isotropic skeleton doesn't yet support buffers.

## Examples
```julia
# Isotropic (default)
results = get_tributary_polygons(vertices)

# Isotropic with weights
results = get_tributary_polygons(vertices; weights=[1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0])

# Partition along x-axis
results = get_tributary_polygons(vertices; axis=[1.0, 0.0])

# Directed with weights
results = get_tributary_polygons(vertices; weights=[1.0, 2.0, 1.0, 2.0], axis=[1.0, 0.0])

# Batch processing with buffers (reduced GC)
buffers = TributaryBuffers()
for cell in cells
    results = get_tributary_polygons(verts; axis=[1.0, 0.0], buffers=buffers)
end
```
