# =============================================================================
# Foundation Strategy Recommendation
# =============================================================================
#
# Uses Voronoi tributary areas and soil bearing capacity to recommend:
#   :spread  — individual spread footings (low coverage)
#   :strip   — spread footings with merging into strips where too close
#   :mat     — full mat foundation (high coverage ratio)
#
# Coverage ratio = Σ(required footing area per column) / building footprint
# =============================================================================

    recommend_foundation_strategy(
        demands, tributary_areas, soil;
        opts = FoundationOptions()
    ) → Symbol

Recommend a foundation strategy based on the coverage ratio.

Each column's required footing area is `Ps / qa`. The coverage ratio is the
sum of these areas divided by the building footprint (convex hull of Voronoi
cells). When coverage exceeds the threshold, a mat foundation is recommended.

# Arguments
- `demands::Vector{FoundationDemand}`: Service + factored loads per column.
- `tributary_areas::Vector{<:Unitful.Area}`: Voronoi tributary area per column.
- `soil::Soil`: `qa` = net allowable bearing pressure.

# Keyword Arguments
- `opts::FoundationOptions`: Contains `mat_coverage_threshold` (default 0.50).

# Returns
- `:spread` — coverage < ~30%, all footings fit comfortably
- `:strip`  — coverage 30–50% or footings overlap, merge some into strips
- `:mat`    — coverage > threshold, go to a full mat

# Example
```julia
strategy = recommend_foundation_strategy(demands, voronoi_areas, soil)
# → :spread, :strip, or :mat
```
