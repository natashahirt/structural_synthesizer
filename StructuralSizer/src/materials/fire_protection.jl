    FireProtection

Abstract type for fire protection systems applied to steel members.

Subtypes control how SFRM/intumescent thickness is determined:
- `NoFireProtection()` — no coating (fire_rating = 0 or steel not exposed)
- `SFRM(density)` — spray-applied fire-resistive material (UL X772 equation)
- `IntumescentCoating(density)` — thin-film intumescent (UL N643 table)
- `CustomCoating(thickness, density, name)` — user-specified, bypasses calculation

Spray-Applied Fire Resistive Material (cementitious fireproofing).

Thickness determined by UL X772 equation:

where R = fire rating (hr), W = weight (lb/ft), D = heated perimeter (in).

Thin-film intumescent coating (mastic).

Thickness determined by UL N643 table lookup based on W/D and fire rating.
Much thinner than SFRM (~0.04"–0.25" vs 0.5"–3"+).

Computed fire protection coating applied to a steel member.

thickness, density, and display name after applying the appropriate UL
listing equation or table.

analysis model: `w = thickness × perimeter × density × g`.

Compute the heated perimeter of a steel section for fire protection volume

For I-sections uses the AISC Design Guide 19 contour perimeters:

  against deck).

Returns perimeter in meters.
