## Overview

The optimization solver module provides three solver backends for structural
member sizing:

- **MIP (Mixed-Integer Programming)**: Discrete section selection from a catalog
  using JuMP with HiGHS (default) or Gurobi (optional).
- **Binary Search**: Catalog-based search for the lightest feasible section per
  demand group, with no solver dependency.
- **NLP (Nonlinear Programming)**: Continuous optimization for problems with
  smooth design variables, using Ipopt or grid search.

All solvers share the `AbstractCapacityChecker` interface for feasibility
evaluation and objective computation.

**Source:** `StructuralSizer/src/optimize/solvers/`

## Key Types

- `AbstractCapacityChecker` — base type for all design code capacity checkers (see [Member Types](../members/types.md)).
- `AbstractCapacityCache` — base type for checker-specific precomputed capacity caches.
- `AbstractMemberGeometry` — base type for member geometry data (unbraced lengths, effective length factors).
- `AbstractNLPProblem` — base type for continuous NLP optimization problems (flat plate, vault).

## Functions

### MIP Solver

- `optimize_discrete(checker, demands, geometries, catalog, material; ...)` — solve a mixed-integer program for discrete section selection from a catalog.

### Binary Search Solver

- `optimize_binary_search(checker, demands, geometries, catalog, material; ...)` — solver-free catalog search for the lightest feasible section per demand group.

### NLP Solver

- `optimize_continuous(problem; ...)` — solve a continuous NLP problem implementing the `AbstractNLPProblem` interface.

## Implementation Details

### MIP Discrete Optimization

`optimize_discrete(checker, demands, geometries, catalog, material; ...)` solves
a mixed-integer program:

**Decision variables:** Binary ``x_{ij} \in \{0, 1\}`` — section ``j``
assigned to group ``i``.

**Objective:** Minimize ``\sum_i \sum_j c_j \cdot x_{ij}`` where ``c_j`` is the
objective coefficient for section ``j`` (weight, volume, cost, or carbon).

**Constraints:**
- Assignment: ``\sum_j x_{ij} = 1`` for each group ``i``
- Feasibility: ``x_{ij} = 0`` for infeasible (section, demand) pairs
- Group linking: Optional constraint that all members in a group share the same
  section

Pre-computation: `precompute_capacities!` evaluates all (section, demand) pairs
up front and marks infeasible combinations.

**Solver selection:**
- HiGHS (default): Open-source, no license required.  The `_HAS_GUROBI` flag
  is checked at module load time.
- Gurobi (optional): Faster for large problems.  Thread-local environments via
  `_get_gurobi_env()` with automatic warmup via `_warmup_jump_solvers()`.

**Multi-material:** An overload accepts a vector of materials and expands the
catalog to (section × material) pairs via `expand_catalog_with_materials`.

### Binary Search

`optimize_binary_search(checker, demands, geometries, catalog, material; ...)`
provides a solver-free alternative:

1. Sort catalog by objective value (ascending)
2. For each demand group, binary search for the lightest feasible section
3. Return the result with per-group section assignments

This is faster than MIP for simple problems (no group-linking constraints) and
has zero solver dependencies.

### NLP Continuous Optimization

`optimize_continuous(problem; ...)` solves continuous NLP problems that implement
the `AbstractNLPProblem` interface:

**Solvers:**
- `:grid` — Grid search with adaptive refinement.  `n_grid` points per
  dimension, `n_refine` levels of zoom around the best point.
- `:ipopt` — Gradient-based via JuMP/Ipopt.  Gradients computed by central
  finite differences (`_numeric_gradient`, step ``\varepsilon = 10^{-6}``).
- `:multistart_ipopt` — Multiple random starting points to escape local minima.
- `:nlopt`, `:nonconvex` — Placeholders for future solvers.

The objective is mapped through `_convert_objective` which converts raw volume
to the selected objective type (weight, cost, carbon) using material densities
and emission factors.

## Limitations & Future Work

- Gurobi requires a valid license; the fallback to HiGHS is automatic but
  may be slower for large problems (> 1000 groups).
- NLP gradients are computed by finite differences, which is slow and
  inaccurate for high-dimensional problems.  Automatic differentiation
  (ForwardDiff.jl) integration is planned.
- The grid search scales as ``O(n^d)`` and is practical only for ≤ 3
  design variables.
- Group-linking constraints in MIP are optional; when disabled, each member
  is sized independently (faster but may produce non-uniform member groups).
- The NLopt and NonConvex backends are stub implementations.
