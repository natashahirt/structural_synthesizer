## Overview

Fire protection in StructuralSizer covers two domains:

1. **Steel fire protection** — spray-applied fire-resistive material (SFRM) and intumescent coatings, sized via UL listing equations
2. **Concrete fire resistance** — minimum cover, thickness, and dimension provisions per ACI 216.1-14

Steel fire protection is modeled as an input type (what the user specifies) and an output type (the computed coating applied to the member). Concrete fire resistance is handled through helper functions that return minimum dimensions — no physical coating is applied.

## Key Types

SFRM
IntumescentCoating
CustomCoating

```

### Input Types (User-Facing)

| Type | Description | Default Density |
|:-----|:------------|:----------------|
| `NoFireProtection()` | No coating applied | — |
| `SFRM(density_pcf)` | Spray-applied fire-resistive material | 15.0 pcf |
| `IntumescentCoating(density_pcf)` | Thin-film intumescent (mastic) | 6.0 pcf |
| `CustomCoating(thickness_in, density_pcf, name)` | User-specified, bypasses calculation | — |

### Output Type

`SurfaceCoating` stores the resolved coating after applying the UL listing equation:

| Field | Type | Description |
|:------|:-----|:------------|
| `thickness_in` | `Float64` | Coating thickness (inches) |
| `density_pcf` | `Float64` | Dry density (pcf) |
| `name` | `String` | Description (e.g., `"SFRM (15 pcf)"`) |

## Steel Fire Protection Functions

intumescent_thickness_n643
compute_surface_coating
```

### compute\_surface\_coating Dispatch

`compute_surface_coating(fp, fire_rating, W_plf, perimeter_in)` dispatches on the `FireProtection` subtype:

| Input Type | Behavior |
|:-----------|:---------|
| `NoFireProtection` | Returns zero-thickness coating |
| `SFRM` | Computes thickness via `sfrm_thickness_x772` using W/D ratio |
| `IntumescentCoating` | Looks up thickness via `intumescent_thickness_n643` table |
| `CustomCoating` | Returns user-specified thickness directly |

## Concrete Fire Resistance Functions (ACI 216.1-14)

min_cover_fire_slab
min_cover_fire_beam
min_cover_fire_column
min_dimension_fire_column
```

### Summary Table

| Function | ACI 216.1-14 Reference | Returns |
|:---------|:-----------------------|:--------|
| `min_thickness_fire(rating, agg)` | Table 4.3.1 | Minimum slab thickness for fire rating |
| `min_cover_fire_slab(rating, agg; restrained)` | Table 4.4.1 | Minimum rebar cover for slab |
| `min_cover_fire_beam(rating, width; restrained)` | Table 4.4.2 | Minimum rebar cover for beam |
| `min_cover_fire_column(rating)` | Table 4.3.2 | Minimum rebar cover for column |
| `min_dimension_fire_column(rating, agg)` | Table 4.3.2 | Minimum column dimension |

## Embodied Carbon Functions

```@docs
coating_volume
coating_mass
coating_ec
```

### Embodied Carbon Accounting

| Function | Returns |
|:---------|:--------|
| `coating_volume(section, coating, L; exposure)` | Volume of coating (m³) |
| `coating_mass(section, coating, L; exposure)` | Mass of coating (kg) |
| `coating_ec(section, coating, L; exposure, ecc)` | Embodied carbon (kgCO₂e) |

The `exposure` keyword controls which perimeter is used:
- `:three_sided` (default, beams) — top flange against deck, `PA` perimeter
- `:four_sided` (columns) — full contour, `PB` perimeter

The default ECC for SFRM is `ECC_SFRM = 0.85` kgCO₂e/kg (CLF baseline for cementitious fireproofing).

## Implementation Details

### UL X772 — SFRM for Steel Members

The SFRM thickness equation from UL Design X772:

```
h = R / (1.05 × (W/D) + 0.61)
```

where:
- `h` = required SFRM thickness (inches)
- `R` = fire rating (hours, 1–4)
- `W` = member weight per unit length (lb/ft)
- `D` = heated perimeter (inches)

The W/D ratio captures the thermal mass of the steel section — heavier sections with less exposed surface require less insulation. This equation applies to 4-sided exposure (columns) and is conservative for 3-sided exposure (beams with deck above).

### UL N643 — Intumescent Coating for Steel Beams

Intumescent thickness is determined by table lookup from UL Design N643, interpolating on W/D ratio and fire rating. Intumescent coatings are much thinner than SFRM (~0.04"–0.25" vs. 0.5"–3"+) but more expensive per unit area.

### ACI 216.1-14 — Concrete Fire Resistance

Concrete fire resistance is governed by:
- **Slab thickness** (Table 4.3.1): Thicker slabs act as better thermal barriers. Carbonate aggregate provides ~15% better fire resistance than siliceous.
- **Rebar cover** (Tables 4.4.1, 4.4.2): Minimum concrete cover protects reinforcement from reaching critical temperature (~1000°F for conventional rebar).
- **Column dimensions** (Table 4.3.2): Minimum column width ensures the core remains cool enough to carry load.

`AggregateType` affects all concrete fire provisions — `carbonate` and `lightweight` aggregates provide better fire resistance than `siliceous`.

## Options & Configuration

| Option | Description |
|:-------|:------------|
| `SFRM(15.0)` | Standard density (most common) |
| `SFRM(22.0)` | Medium density (better adhesion) |
| `SFRM(40.0)` | High density (blast/impact resistance) |
| `IntumescentCoating(6.0)` | Standard intumescent |
| `restrained` kwarg | `true` for restrained assemblies (lower cover requirements) |

## Limitations & Future Work

- **Fire ratings**: Currently supports 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 hour ratings. Non-standard ratings are interpolated.
- **Concrete spalling**: ACI 216.1-14 spalling provisions (supplementary reinforcement for covers > 2.5") are not modeled.
- **Composite fire resistance**: Fire resistance of composite steel-concrete members (AISC Design Guide 19 Chapter 5) is not yet implemented.
- **Cost model**: Fire protection cost (installed $/ft²) is not tracked. Only embodied carbon is computed.
