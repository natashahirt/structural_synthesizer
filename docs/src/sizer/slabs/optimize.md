## Overview

The slab optimization module provides continuous (NLP) optimization for flat
plate and vault slab systems.  It wraps the structural design pipeline as
constraint functions and minimizes material volume (or other objectives) over
continuous design variables.

Two problem types are implemented:
- **`FlatPlateNLPProblem`**: 2D grid search over slab thickness and column
  size for flat plate design
- **`VaultNLPProblem`**: 1D or 2D optimization of vault rise and/or thickness

**Source:** `StructuralSizer/src/slabs/optimize/`

## Key Types

```@docs

VaultNLPProblem
```

- `VaultOptMode` — abstract type for vault optimization mode selection.
- `OptBoth` — optimize both rise and thickness (2 variables).
- `OptRise` — optimize rise only (thickness fixed, 1 variable).
- `OptThickness` — optimize thickness only (rise fixed, 1 variable).

## Implementation Details

### FlatPlateNLPProblem

The flat plate optimization uses a 2D grid search over:
- ``h`` — slab thickness (inches)
- ``c`` — column dimension (inches)

For each ``(h, c)`` pair, the evaluator runs:
1. DDM moment analysis
2. Punching shear check at all columns
3. One-way shear check
4. Strip reinforcement design (trying multiple bar sizes)
5. Flexural adequacy check

The objective combines concrete volume (``h \times A_{\text{panel}}``) and
reinforcing steel volume (from the lightest feasible bar size), scaled by
configurable weights.

The problem implements the standard `AbstractNLPProblem` interface and is
solved via `optimize_continuous` (see [Optimization Solvers](../optimize/solvers.md)).

### VaultNLPProblem

The vault optimization solves for the minimum-volume shell geometry subject to
stress and convergence constraints:

**Variables:**
- `OptBoth`: rise ``f`` and thickness ``t`` (2 variables)
- `OptRise`: rise ``f`` only (thickness fixed, 1 variable)
- `OptThickness`: thickness ``t`` only (rise fixed, 1 variable)

**Objective:** Shell volume per plan area = ``t \times S / L`` where ``S`` is
the parabolic arc length.

**Constraints:**
1. Stress: ``\sigma_{\max} / \sigma_{\text{allow}} \leq 1``
2. Convergence: elastic shortening iteration must converge

The mode is auto-detected from which bounds/values are provided:
- `lambda_bounds` or `rise_bounds` → rise is a variable
- `thickness_bounds` → thickness is a variable
- Fixed `lambda`/`rise` + fixed `thickness` → direct evaluation (no optimization)

### Solver Integration

Both problem types use `optimize_continuous` from the solver module, which
supports:
- Grid search with adaptive refinement (`_optimize_grid`)
- Ipopt via JuMP (gradient-based, with numeric central-difference gradients)
- Multi-start Ipopt for non-convex landscapes

## Options & Configuration

### FlatPlateNLPProblem

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|:----------|:--------|:------------|
| `h_max` | `24 in.` | Maximum slab thickness |
| `c_min` | `12 in.` | Minimum column dimension |
| `c_max` | `48 in.` | Maximum column dimension |
| `bar_sizes` | `[4, 5, 6, 7]` | Candidate rebar sizes |
| `n_grid` | `20` | Grid resolution per dimension |
| `n_refine` | `2` | Refinement iterations |

### VaultNLPProblem

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|:----------|:--------|:------------|
| `lambda_bounds` | `(10, 20)` | Span-to-rise ratio bounds (λ = span/rise) |
| `thickness_bounds` | `(0.03m, 0.30m)` | Shell thickness bounds |
| `allowable_stress` | ``0.45 f'_c`` | Maximum compressive stress |
| `deflection_limit` | ``L/360`` | Elastic shortening convergence |

### optimize_vault API

The `optimize_vault` function provides a high-level API that internally:
1. Resolves rise/thickness from mixed input formats
2. Detects the optimization mode (`OptBoth`, `OptRise`, `OptThickness`)
3. Builds and solves the `VaultNLPProblem`
4. Returns a `VaultResult` with full geometry and checks

## Limitations & Future Work

- `FlatPlateNLPProblem` uses DDM only—EFM and FEA are not available in the
  optimization wrapper.
- The flat plate evaluator does not iterate on deflection within each grid
  point; infeasible points are penalized but not grown.
- Vault optimization assumes parabolic geometry only.
- Multi-objective optimization (e.g., Pareto front of cost vs. carbon) is not
  yet implemented.
- The grid search is effective for 2D problems but does not scale to higher
  dimensions.
