## Overview

**menegroth** is an end-to-end building generation and structural design platform. It produces fully sized structural systems — beams, columns, slabs, and foundations — from a parametric building skeleton, complete with embodied carbon accounting and fire protection sizing.

The platform consists of two Julia packages plus an HTTP API:

| Package | Purpose | Key Entry Points |
|:--------|:--------|:-----------------|
| **StructuralSynthesizer** | Building-level workflows: geometry generation, tributary analysis, design pipelines, post-processing, and the HTTP API | `gen_medium_office`, `design_building`, `DesignParameters` |
| **StructuralSizer** | Component-level structural design: materials, loads, sections, design code checks (AISC 360, ACI 318, NDS), slab design, foundation design, and optimization | `A992_Steel`, `LoadCombination`, `FlatPlateOptions` |
| **Asap** | Units, type aliases, and finite element analysis (FEM) | `kip`, `ksi`, `psf`, `Model`, `solve!` |
| **StructuralPlots** | Makie themes, color palettes, figure utilities for publication-quality plots | `sp_light`, `sp_dark`, `fullwidth` |
| **StructuralStudies** | Parametric research studies built on StructuralSizer + StructuralPlots | — |

**Dependency chain:** `Asap` → `StructuralSizer` → `StructuralSynthesizer`

## How It Works

1. **Generate** a building skeleton (`BuildingSkeleton`) with plan dimensions, bay counts, and story heights.
2. **Wrap** the skeleton in a `BuildingStructure` that holds cells, members, slabs, and analysis caches.
3. **Design** the structure with `design_building`, which runs a multi-stage pipeline: initialize cells, estimate column sizes, build the FEM model, size beams/columns/slabs/foundations, and compute embodied carbon.
4. **Inspect** the returned `BuildingDesign` for member sizes, slab thicknesses, foundation dimensions, total weight, and embodied carbon breakdown.

## Safety-Critical Software

!!! warning "Structural Engineering Code"
    This codebase is used for **structural engineering design**. Incorrect code can lead to
    unsafe designs. Every calculation is treated as safety-critical:

    - All design code implementations cite specific clause numbers (e.g., AISC 360-16 §F2, ACI 318-19 §22.2).
    - Unit consistency is enforced via [Unitful.jl](https://github.com/PainterQubits/Unitful.jl) throughout.
    - Embodied carbon coefficients are sourced from the ICE Database v4.1.
    - Results should always be verified by a licensed professional engineer.
